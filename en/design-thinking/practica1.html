            <div class="think__title__content">
                <p>In this opportunity using the Design Thinking tool we have decided to propose a solution based on a problem in the city of Arequipa, all this is through a series of stages such as surveys, information search, etc. All this just to give the comfort of the residents who are involved with this problem.</p>
                <p>That is why we propose the solution in the form of a service, being this one mostly to the municipalities which will be advised and planned from the best dates to carry out projects or works until the deviation routes of the vehicles to decongest several of them. the routes that will be filled with cars.</p>
                <p>For this occasion we counted on the advice of a civil engineer who could give us details of how are the plans of the municipalities and the big mistakes that are made when intercepting two works at the same time and how they leave some unfinished works on their side .</p>

                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">As the main objective of this project we have to analyze and propose a solution to the set of works that is carried out in simultaneous since so many works executing have several consequences as traffic, stress on drivers and passers-by, etc. That is why we planted a plan to be able to execute in an orderly manner all the works that are necessary but without affecting the town.</p>
                    <p class="think__details__info__title">SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT</p>
                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">Day by day we see how our city has a deficit in what is the road management, this is due to several factors, excess of vehicles, narrow roads, peak hours of transfer, public works, poor management of the last. In several parts of the city this happens and causes us great chaos and a loss both economic and social, as time is lost, fuel, and recent studies have determined that this causes stress, making drivers not want to drive and prefer some public transport vehicle.</p>
                    <p class="think__details__info__title">PROPOSAL</p>
                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">Our proposal is based on the people because this is the most affected this congestion, we select the most common problem in the city and is the cause of all this, for which we propose a solution in which the population and the population will be made aware. transporters in terms of road culture, and a plan of works to the municipalities, so that many works are not executed at the same time causing the detours to collapse of the automotive overload <; another problem would be buses or public transport combis since they represent a large number of vehicles, and these are larger damage to personal vehicles, causing another chaos but with much relation to the works.</p>
