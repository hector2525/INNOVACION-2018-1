                <p>In this stage we will explain what Design Thinking is, the methods that it uses on the basis of which this proposal arises, how this proposal has been developed in other places and the positive changes that gender.</p>

                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">As we see in video 1 and in image 1 you can appreciate that they give us a series of steps in which Design Thinking consists and makes it very interesting as a method of solving problems, considering the opinion of the population as the main affected and principal beneficiary. , this is how the investigations should be done, in order to look for the common good and the population with only one purpose.</p>

                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Empathize</p>
                    <p>Empathizing consists in interacting with the public, being one of the ways of knowing their opinion of them and making them respect, considering the parameters in which we are allowed, and evaluating the situation that is going to be treated.</p>

                <div class="think__details__extra">
                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Define</p>
                    <p>In this part we will have to finish collecting the information in order to pose the problem and its solution, this is why we must help any information method such as internet, magazines, reports on the subject.</p>

                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Devise</p>
                    <p>At this point is where the brainstorming of ideas has flowed because not only is there a solution to the problem and it is how the whole group should participate actively by attaching their point of view.</p>

                <div class="think__details__extra">
                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Prototype</p>
                    <p>Once the ideas have been obtained, we will proceed to shape the project, making it take shape until it is completely elaborated. Once done, we will test it for a certain period of time and with periodic evaluations so that if something happens badly we can improve the project as it says. name is a prototype which must have 0 errors in the best case.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="think__details__extra">
                    <p class="think__details__extra__title">Test</p>
                    <p>As previously stated, the project will be tested so that you will have to ask and see the results in the people that you want to be benefited and they also give us their point of view.</p>
