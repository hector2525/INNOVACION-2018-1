                <p>At this stage we will be pleased to present the different and varied views of people, or residents who are being harmed by this traffic congestion throughout the city of Arequipa, for this we went through one of the largest avenues in the city and one of the most important as is the AV. The US is currently remodeling on what is the track but at the same time and as it is a main avenue, it causes one of the biggest traffics at present.</p>

                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">Here a series of encustas was made to residents and transporters who are being affected in various parts of the city with the problem of chaos, this is how knowing the opinion and suggestions of the population we can get to work together with the municipality and not against , affecting themselves.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> First the opinion of the population.</li>
                        <li> Consequences of the project towards the population and solution.</li>
                        <li> Reaction of the population before the project.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We begin by having a series of questions which will help us to have and learn more about the thoughts and contributions of the people regarding the vehicle management in Arequipa, and later to know according to them what are the points or causes for which the traffic in Arequipa is So overwhelming and how to solve it, after that we will propose our proposal by making known one of the solutions to traffic in Arequipa.</p>
                    <p>These questions are:</p>
                    <p> How do you consider the vehicular traffic in Arequipa?</p>
                    <p> What problems do you think this congestion causes?</p>
                    <p> Are you satisfied with the work done by the municipalities to reduce this traffic?</p>
                </div>
                 <p>As it could be observed, 3 people involved in what would be vehicular management, a traffic policeman, were interviewed, they try to eliminate this congestion and bring order to the vehicles, being an arduous job, an owner of a driving license company , being one of the people who instruct the drivers, and in charge of teaching them everything about the vehicular management, and finally a taxi driver, as we know they are workers who are very involved in the traffic and at the same time harmed, and knowing the opinion of the 3 can make a more detailed analysis of their needs. </p>
